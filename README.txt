This is a Microsoft studio dump of all my work done in my cybersecurity degree. 
I wish I started uploading this when I started this degree to help build up this account but here I am.
99% of this is programs for classes from programing1 (c++) to networking and so on.
DO NOT RELY ON ANY OF THIS CODE! IT IS ALL FOR SHOW AND TELL! 
If somthing does not work its because I decided to brick it so that other cant use it. Totaly not because It dosnt work...
